New branded keypad by Rickard Security

Professional Metal keypad access controller comes with a two year guarantee for product failure. The system can be bought with key tags or cards (please request a quote) which can be programmed into the unit by the number engraved or printed on them. The cards or tags can also be deleted by this method of keying in the number to delete so tags and fobs are easily removed and replaced from the system. This also gives greater flexibility in the future because if the reader fails the existing tags and fobs can be programmed into the new unit by the numbers. Also the tags or cards can be added in bulk by placing the tag to the reader in programming mode and adding in sequence.
